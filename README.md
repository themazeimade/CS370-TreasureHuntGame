# CS370-TreasureHuntGame

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The TreasureHuntGame project consists of two Python modules: one that defines the environment (the maze) and another that manages the experience (the class responsible for storing the agentâ€™s memory and handling model fit sampling). The main component of the project is the .ipynb file, which contains the model configuration, display setup, and testing methods for evaluating the final model.

The code I created focused on the main training procedure. The assignment prompt required me to develop a DQN (Deep Q-Network) training model using all the provided utilities, but the DQN itself had to be designed by me.

The process was not straightforward and went through several iterations to improve performance. I had to seek outside help to use an NVIDIA GPU, which helped reduce training time. Additionally, I modified the training procedures, for example, I downsized the training models from two to one and changed from a dynamic epsilon to a constant value.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

 * What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists help design, plan, and develop software solutions. There are many subfields within the computer science discipline, such as computer graphics, parallel programming, artificial intelligence, and data science. Since the 1950s, computer science has played a major role in advancing many areas, including the military and supply chain management. The role of computer science in every aspect of a globalized world is what makes it so important. In any field, from biological research to supermarket management, there is a solution developed by a computer science team that helps increase productivity and efficiency.

 * How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
   
To begin with, the computer scientist needs to critically analyze the problem and abstract its key details. From those details, a set of requirements, developed with feedback from stakeholders, is created, and classes are designed and planned. Development should proceed with constant communication between the end users and stakeholders. In my opinion, the most important aspect is the abstraction of the problem into real code, which translates into a more tailored experience for the users.

 * What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

The main ethical concerns and responsibilities of a computer scientist involve the handling of private data, whether it comes from development processes or private client information. Both require careful management and secure storage. Proper procedures and encryption must be applied to ensure the most reliable and secure systems.

Other ethical concerns include how computer scientists use data and how their actions affect other parties. Do we impact the end user by making them more addicted to our services? Where do we draw the line? These are some of the important questions we must ask ourselves.
